## About

This tool takes a modlist file from a CurseForge modpack and attempt to find mods that are available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and output a [mrpack](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802351-modrinth-modpack-format-mrpack)'s `modrinth.index.json` file.

### Motivation

> [iwillreku3206](https://github.com/iwillreku3206/curseforge-to-modrinth)
> In mid-2022, popular 3rd-party Minecraft launcher, [MultiMC](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher) was requested to [remove support](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/commit/0a827ba70e6ef20187f8507a536d54a8441020dc) for downloading modpacks from CurseForge, by Overwolf. Considering that CurseForge announced more restrictions on their API before this, it was only a matter of time before Overwolf starts prohibiting 3rd-party launchers
